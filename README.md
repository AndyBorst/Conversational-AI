# Conversational-AI
Conversational AI as a class, taught by Dr. Larry Heck, focused on the background and history of large language models, as well as the current state of the art in the industry. The first half of the class focused on the mathemtical foundations of bayesian theory, stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, recursive neural networks, and finally transformers, with particular emphasis on their use in previous state of the art LLM's. The second half functioned as a research review of various papers to show the current state of the art and analyze how it's used in modern chatbots such as ChatGPT, Llama 2, and Bing Chat. For our final project, we trained a 7B parameter Llama 2 LLM to function as a curriculum advisor for the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Georgia Tech. We did this by webscraping for copious amounts of data, and then creating software to train the LLM on our dataset. These codes can be found inside of this repository.
